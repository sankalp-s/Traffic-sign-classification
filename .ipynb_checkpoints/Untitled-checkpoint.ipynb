      "     Want with this course is that students know situate the Portuguese public administration in the political history and social context in the contemporary era Let them know to discuss current challenges and constraints of the central and local APP in the light of the structural foundations of its limitations and especially the requirement of reform Administrative its framework in the European Union but also want students to gain a global understanding of the problems and issues of the AP by the knowledge of the main currents of the General Theory of Management aims to further students to start in understanding the maze of Public administration and the use that may have the networks in the current technological context at the end of the Course students should have acquired knowledge and skills to enable them to recognize the specific characteristics of the Portuguese Public administration Considering the current public administration students should know their evolution historical view of the economic and social poítico equandramento expected to also recognize the influence of management theories in practice the public sector and European Portuguese as well as critically analyze the challenges facing the current government presentation and questioning of the syllabus and practical work to conduct with accompanying teaching the course is organized on display and theoretical lessons TP practical classes classes should not be monologues of the teaching class participation is considered important and is an element of the final evaluation attendance is therefore doubly important the essential bibliography It will be made available in a timely manner so that learners can read in advance the material needed to follow the discussions of the classes  \\\n",
